# TPC-FastSim

We must develop two new generative models of different kinds and architectures, and check their
generative performance, so that for them to possibly serve as possible substitutes or addendums for
the original baseline WGAN generative model of Maevskiy and his research team. Furthermore, we
must conduct a research on hyperparameters of the initial mode, so that to suggest a possibly better
set of theirs to be further tuned in the main model.

Our respective research objectives are thus:

1. Develop a conditional Variational Autoencoder generative model, which would produce the pad
response simulations of the baseline-comparable quality.
2. Develop a conditional Normalizing Flows model, which would produce the pad response simulations
of the baseline-comparable quality.
3. Find locally optimal hyperparameters for the baseline model, so that its time/quality performance
becomes better, compared to the original parameters-fitted model.
4. Suggest possible ways for further improvement of the reference model, based on the results of
our model development and parameter tuning.
